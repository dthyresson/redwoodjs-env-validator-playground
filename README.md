# redwoodjs-env-validator-playground

This app is an example implementation of the [netlify-plugin-redwoodjs-env-validator](https://github.com/dthyresson/netlify-plugin-redwoodjs-env-validator).

The [Netlify Builld Plugin](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/) helps to validate [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) [environment variables](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/environment-variables) when [deploying](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/) to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

It aims to check that the environment variables needed for a healthy running RedwoodJS app have been properly setup; and it helps to keep them in sync betwen the `.env.defaults` to `redwood.toml` and the deployment environment configuration.
